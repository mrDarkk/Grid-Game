## Problem Statement: 
>It's play time, people!    
Many kids initial fascination with computers, like that of nerdy kids, had to do with computer games. They were drawn into the tiny simulated worlds that they could manipulate and in which stories (sort of) unfolded—more, I suppose, because of the way they projected their imagination into them than because of the possibilities they actually offered.  
I don’t wish a career in game programming on anyone. Much like the music industry, the discrepancy between the number of eager young people wanting to work in it and the actual demand for such people creates a rather unhealthy environment. **But writing games for fun is amusing**.  
In this milestone, you are going to create one of the following grid games.  
We will use the browser DOM to display the game, and we’ll read user input by handling key events.
>### 1.Image Puzzle game:
>Image puzzle is a game where you can drag and drop image parts to swap and re-arrange the parts to form the complete image.  
You can play the game online [here](http://www.anuraggandhi.com/imagepuzzle/puzzle.html)  
The rules of the game is simple. You just need to drag and drop the broken image pieces to swap it. You need to swap them in a way it form the correct image. The number of steps taken to drag and drop the image parts will be counted. So, you may wish to think and try to do it in minimum possible steps. The correct image is provided at right hand side for your reference.  
The screen for the game looks like this:
